## Configurations

## Contributing

Always open an issue before sending a PR. Talk about the problem/feature that you want to fix. If it’s really a good thing you can submit your PR. If you send an PR without talking about before what it is, you may work for nothing.

<!-- ## Goal
This work comes as tribute to LTM, hoping to spread the style and the themes of the magazine.
I love both Zola and Pelican theme, but I know that Rust can be even more "resource efficient"

La mia ambizione è che the author choose this theme as the new default, but it doesn't matter if
he doesn't: se riesco a fare impiegare questo tema a più persone è già un successo.
